# ParaGraph
A simple graphing calculator developed in Java using the Eclipse IDE. Began as a demonstration of parametric equations, hence the name. Features in the README

Can graph up to degree-3 polynomials and their derivatives. 
Currently has some bugs with:
- displaying the right information for roots and extrema
- plotting points of interest, which typically only appear at extrema or intercepts, at arbitrary points

Todo:
- Newton root estimation
- Graphing irrational roots/extrema
- More parent functions - currently working on trig functions
